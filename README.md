# Memory Game Project


## What is the Memory Game
This is the game for testing users memory. There are 8 pairs of cards. Users' challenge is to match the cards with shortest moves and time.


## Instructions
* Click on a card
* Remember the icons of opened cards and find the other pair.
* click **Restart Game** button to play a new game


## How I built the Memory Game
I mostly code on JS file to make game interactive and functional. I also needed to make some changes on HTML and CSS.
* Font Awesome icons are used to create cards.
* created a modal that opens when user open the game.
* created 16 cards (8 pairs in total) that shuffles when game is refreshed.
* created counter for moves and clock. 
* created restart button to restart the game with shuffled cards.
* crated a modal when player complete the game. Modal shows game statistics.
